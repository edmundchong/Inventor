**IMPORTANT**

- do not use if you want 100% guaranteed rigidity
- These 3D printed parts have more variance than Thorlabs of course. 
- For tapping, do NOT tap all the way through, and you will be able to screw very tightly
- depending on how much you manage to tighten the screw, the post can be very secure (but still not as secure as thorlabs part)
