**IMPORTANT**

- do not use if you want 100% guaranteed rigidity
- These 3D printed parts have more variance than Thorlabs of course. 
- For tapping, tap carefully and do not overtap, and you will be able to screw very tightly
  - but also do not overtighten otherwise the screw will cut into the acrylic and then you won't be able to tighten after
  - you may require some trial and error to get a feel for the limits
- depending on how much you manage to tighten the screw, the post can be very secure (but still not as secure as thorlabs part)
