## Notes

### Mods
- The magnet holder has been modified to include a more standard magnet size (4mm x 4mm) - RS 2192244
- The cable holder has been modified to hold two SPI cables horizontally
- The Top Mount A has been modified to include an M6 mount, so it can be screwed into a 40mm x 40mm aluminium strut. The screws are M6 x 30mm (RS 290-146 or for cheaper ones, RS 473-3776)
- The slip ring stage has been modified to have bigger 4.6mm insert holes (these accomodate HANGLIFE Threaded Inserts for Plastic, M3 Heat Set Insert for 3D Printing Components and Plastic Parts - Brass Metric Knurled Nuts (100 Pieces) on Amazon). Also got rid of extra holes, so now the slip ring only fits the SENRING 36 circuit capsule slip ring

### Issues
- The top com mount is too shallow to accomodate the heat sink on the step motor driver - you can leave the heat sink out, as its only really needed when the motor on is 24/7 (aka the motor probably won't overheat without the heat sink in this case)
