## Assembly Steps
1. Print the adapter
2. Tap the larger middle hole with M6


- tap the larger hole with M6 (M6 X 12MM)
- 
- 
  - screwdriver e.g. RS PRO Pozidriv, PZ0 Tip
- I made this change so that it is compatible with the rest of the setup which uses metric screws
    - digression:
      - there are imperial t-slot nuts
      - thorlabs has 1/2" optical posts with imperial threads at the bottom
      - and screw adapters to go from metric to imperial
      - but there are some weird / difficult combinations and too much trouble in the end
