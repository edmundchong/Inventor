# Cam Mount Adapter Step by Step Assembly 

## Notes
- Mounting piece for the cheap ELP USB cameras off Amazon
- This replaces the original on the camera--(screw threads 1/4-20). I made this change so that it is compatible with the rest of the setup which uses metric screws
- The two small screws which attach the part to the camera, are #0
- Digression
  
      - There are imperial t-slot nuts
      - Thorlabs has 1/2" optical posts with imperial threads at the bottom
      - And screw adapters to go from metric to imperial
      - But there are some weird / difficult combinations and too much trouble in the end
