# Buzzer Electronics

## Components
- 3 buzzers with positive and negative pin wires
- Arduino Uno
- USB power supply (arduino -> computer)

## Notes 
- Connections are made directly to the arduino (no breadboard)
- White goes to ground on arduino
- Make sure the arduino is disconnected when making changes to wiring

## Instructions 
1. Make sure your buzzer wires are labelled (left buzzer, middle buzzer, right buzzer)
2. Connect pins of buzzer wires to the following arduino ports:

`Middle_buzzer_white_wire` -> `any GND on arduino`

`Middle_buzzer_pink_wire` -> `pin 3`

--

`Left_buzzer_white_wire` -> `any GND on arduino`

`Left_buzzer_pink_wire` -> `pin 6`

--

`Right_buzzer_white_wire` -> `any GND on arduino` 

`Right_buzzer_pink_wire` -> `pin 9`
