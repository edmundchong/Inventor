# Lick Spout Wiring

## Notes 
- Full details can be found at https://github.com/clamlab/bonsai/tree/main/Lick/cap1188

## Materials 
1. Breadboard
2. CAP118
3. Arduino UNO
4. Jumpwire kit
5. Power supply

## Intructions
- Prepare 2 banks of 13 pins
- Position the banks on the CAP118 (spanning from MOSI to AD / SDA TO IRQ) on both sides
- Solder the banks on the CAP118
- Insert the CAP118 onto a breadboard (specific position doesn't matter, but for guidance, you can position the SDA pin on i11 and the MOSI pin on f11)
