# Setting up rig electronics 

## Components 
- Arduino Uno with shield, connected to breadboard (-> pump)
- Arduino Uno with CAP118 on breadboard (-> lick spout)
- Arduino Uno only (no breadboard) (-> buzzers)

- Wire dimensions
  - 

## Notes
- Length of wires should be approx 1.5 meters (~2 arms length). This is to account for the reach between the rig and the electronics panel housing the arduino / Breadboards.
- When moving rigs into the behavioural room, the following is the easiest order of assembly:
  1. **3D printed holders**: Mount all arduinos and breadboards to the 3D printed holders
  2. **Panel**: Mount electronics panel
  3. **Mount electronics**: Screw in arduinos and breadboards to panel via the 3D printed holders
  4. **Move rig**: Insert rig into the soundproof boxes
  5. **Thread wires**: Thread all the wiring through the hole in the side of the box, one by one, and connect to breadboards.
  6. **Power**: Connect the power supplies to the valve breadboard and LED strips.
  7. **Switches**: Connect the arduinos to the inline switches (but don't connect to PC yet)
  8. **Mount switches**: Mount the switches onto the 3D printed holder, and screw into the panel
  9. **PC**: Position the PC tower, and connect to power
  10. **Other PC hardware**: Connect cameras, touchscreen, mouse/keyboard to PC
  11. **Start-up**: Boot PC and set up any desk
  12. **Connect**: Connect the arduino USBs one by one, making a note of which COM ports they've been assigned to
  13. **Bonsai**: Test hardware with bonsai
