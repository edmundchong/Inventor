# Notes

- Secure switch mounts with M5 x 16mm
- Secure arduino / breadboard mounts with M5 x 10mm
- Secure arduino to holder with M3 x 6mm
- One panel houses the electronics for 3 rigs:

One panel requires:
- 3 x switch holders
- 3 x arduino holders
- 6 x arduino-breadboard holders

## 3D printing guidance
- For the switch holders use the following settings (otherwise the supports are really hard to remove!)
    - Support overhang angle: 60
    - Support density: 50%
    - Support structure: normal
- The rest of the settings can be default (Extra fast draft, triangle infill at 20%)
