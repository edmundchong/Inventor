## Assembly Steps 
1. Laser cut the base
2. Use the saw to cut 7 x struts measuring 32.5cm in height
3. Attach the struts according to https://github.com/edmundchong/Inventor/blob/main/Touchscreen%20arena/box%20walls/01%20base/base%20struts%20schematic.pdf
  - struts labelled 1-4 are laid flat (parallel to base), screwed in with T-slot nut + M5 x 10mm
  - struts labelled 5 (six of them) are screwed in with M5 x 16mm, tapped at end

strut lengths:
1. 2.5  cm
2. 8.5  cm
3. 5    cm
4. 13.5 cm
5. 30   cm (?)
