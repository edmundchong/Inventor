## Assembly Steps
1. Laser cut the drill guides from a scrap piece of acrylic
2. Use these guides as a template sawing the aluminium extrusion. You need to cut two short and one long piece, per rig
3. Line up the drill guide with the cut aluminium extrusions, and use a sharpie to mark the location of the holes
4. Use a drill (drill size?) to cut the holes in the aluminium. 
5. 3D print 6 connectors, for attaching the aluminium to the struts of the rig
6. Screw in the connectors to the aluminium using (screw size?) screws.
7. The aluminium is now ready to be mounted onto the struts
