# LED Strips Step by Step
- Each box contains 3 LED Strips, on the SWE walls.
- Each LED strip is mounted via 2 3D printed connectors (screw size?)

## Materials 
- LED Strips

    - Since the total length of the LED strips mounted is about a metre, we need 12V and > 1.2A
- Aluminium extrusion (Attached to LED strip as heat sinks)

## Assembly Steps
1. Laser cut the drill guides from a scrap piece of acrylic
2. Use these guides as a template sawing the aluminium extrusion. You need to cut two short and one long piece, per rig
3. Line up the drill guide with the cut aluminium extrusions, and use a sharpie to mark the location of the holes
4. Use a drill (drill size?) to cut the holes in the aluminium. 
5. 3D print 6 connectors, for attaching the aluminium to the struts of the rig
6. For the longer aluminium extrusions, cut LED strips of the same length and stick them to the flat internal edge of the aluminium
7. Solder the copper edges of the LED strip to some wire; there should be 2 wires coming out of the LED, one positive and one negative. Do this for both LED strips
9. Screw in the connectors to the aluminium using M3 X 8mm screws.
10. With the aluminium attached to the connector, screw in the connector to the strut T bolt using a M5 x 5mm screw
11. With the LED strips now mounted on the rig, twist the positive wires coming from the two LED strips together. Seperatley, twist the negative wires together
12. Insert the twisted pos/neg wires into a female plug connector
13. Solder the male plug connector to a 12V power plug
14. Test that the LED strips come on under an IR camera
