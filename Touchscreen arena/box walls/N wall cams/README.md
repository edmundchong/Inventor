# North Wall Cam Assembly Step by Step

## Materials
- Laser cut black + transparent red acrylic (5mm thick)
- Chloroform

## Assembly Instructions
1. Laser cut the bigger black piece of acrylic and the smaller red piece
2. Use chloroform to join the two pieces together (the smaller piece slots into the cut out bigger black piece)


## mounting the cameras (x2)
0. see: https://github.com/edmundchong/Inventor/blob/main/Touchscreen%20arena/box%20walls/N%20wall%20cams/mounting%20instructions.pdf
1. each cam connects by M6 setscrew (16mm) to Thorlabs TR30/M posts
  - but using the 3d printed adapter ("cam M6 replacement")
2. TR30/M post slides into the 3d-printed RA180
  - the fit is tight--try to make the base of the post, flush with the base of the hole
  - and is locked by M5 x 6mm (the screw hole needs to be tapped)
  - **WARNING!!** do not overtighten the M5 screw, because it is 3d-printed it's not super robust
3. RA180 then attaches to the strut by M5 x 10mm + M5 T-slot nut
4. change angle of cameras by unlocking the M5 x 6mm screw and turning the post
