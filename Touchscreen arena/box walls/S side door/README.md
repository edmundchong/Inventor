- 2 hinges per door (RS-9174539)
- 10 of 5mm x 5mm neodymium magnets
- to ensure the doors can open and close smoothly:
  - cut must be precise, and keep pieces paired (to reduce mating error)
      - whatever pieces that are cut together, stay together
  - avoid getting glue on mating surfaces, and make sure the magnets are fully in the slot, flush with the door edge
  - door handle: 2 of M5 x 10mm screws, tap door handle
