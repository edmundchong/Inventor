## Instructions 
1. 3D print the left and right mounts from the GitHub .stl file
2. screw them into the corresponding struts
   - if the screwdriver is too short -- e.g. the handle bumps against the vertical strut when you're trying to screw in,
     - you can connect the mount to the flat strut before screwing the flat strut to the base
