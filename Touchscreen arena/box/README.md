- general: glue magnets using gorilla glue, must minimize amount of glue on magnet mating surface (put some in hole before pushing magnet in, and apply more on opposite surface after)

- Door handle: 2 x (M5 x 16mm)
- orientation of box walls:
  - front: screen (define as north)
  - side door: east, rig door
  - back: south, reward port goes here

### Back wall
- reward port (3d print: reward port/liquid_port_vXX.stl) will mate here
  - has specific mating orientation enforced by protruding triangle 
- round holes for magnets
  - 5mm diameter x 3mm thickness on wall
  - 5mm diameter x 3mm thickness on liquid port 3d print


### Side Door
- for laser cutting, when opening the pdf in CorelDraw, it automatically sets the rectangular slots of magnet holes to have white fill--this will affect the laser cut.
  - Solution: select the entire object and change the fill of everything to no fill
- Door magnets: round 5mm diameter, 5mm thickness, RS 2192245, total 6
- door hinges: Pinet Stainless Steel Butt Hinge, Screw Fixing, 50mm x 50mm x 2mm, RS Components 917-4539, total 2
