- mounting piece for the cheap ELP USB cameras off Amazon
  - e.g. ELP KL36IR 1080P Full HD Infrared Night Vision PC Camera 720P/60FPS Plug and Play Camera Video Web Cam USB with IR Cut
- tap the larger hole with M6
- this replaces the original on the camera--(screw threads 1/4-20)
- the two small screws which attach the part to the camera, are #0
  - screwdriver e.g. RS PRO Pozidriv, PZ0 Tip
- I made this change so that it is compatible with the rest of the setup which uses metric screws
    - digression:
      - there are imperial t-slot nuts
      - thorlabs has 1/2" optical posts with imperial threads at the bottom
      - and screw adapters to go from metric to imperial
      - but there are some weird / difficult combinations and too much trouble in the end
