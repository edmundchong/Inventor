### laser cut instructions 

- red clear acrylic 5mm
- Trotec + Corel Draw @ SWC Makerspace 06.25.2024
- cut (red lines) and engraving (black lines) done on separate cuts / using separate print files
  - because I use separate settings for the engraving (different from the engraving settings for Acrylic 5mm cutting)
- engraving
  - use to guide where to glue the legs (fixation vXX base bottom engraving.pdf) or walls (fixation vXX base top engraving.pdf)
  - set line width to 0.5 (not hairline)
  - use the lightest engraving setting--I found one for 1.6mm acrylic
- lines set to green will be ignored
