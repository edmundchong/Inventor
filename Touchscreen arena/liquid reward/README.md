- drill one 3mm diameter hole into falcon tube cap
  - slot in using 3.3mm (measured) OD 1.5mm ID silicone tubing
  - to make it easier to slot in initially, can cut the tubing at an angle
- drill one additional small hole (any small size e.g. 1mm) that allows air to enter as milk is pumped out (and prevent vacuum from forming)
