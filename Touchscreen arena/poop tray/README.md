## Constructing Poop Trays

1. Laser cut the base and walls using TROTEC
2. Align the thick walls along the bottom and sides of the base plate (with the handle cut outs facing the top)
3. Align the narrow walls on the top of the base plate, parallel to the handle cut outs
4. Apply chloroform using a p200 pipette, at the intersection where the panels meet the base plate.
5. Press firmly to adhere the panels, and reapply generously until the plastics are melted together
6. Leave outside to dry
