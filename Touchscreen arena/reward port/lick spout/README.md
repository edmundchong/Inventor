# Cutting Lick Spouts

## Equipment 
- Dremmel drill (3rd floor lab)
- Round blade with rough surface
- Oral Dosing Needle (http://)
- Pliers

## Instructions 
- Before you start, make sure the dremmel is turned off both at the wall, and on the drill. The speed should be set to the minimum before turning anything on

# Cutting
1. Use pliers to hold on to the trunk of the drill. Turn the screw on the end of the drill to loosen / tighten it, whilst holding onto the trunk
2. Loosen the drill bit, and insert the round blade all the way
3. Tighten the drill screw with your fingers, holding on to the trunk with the pliers. **Ensure the screw is tight and the blade cannot be pulled off**
4. Turn on the dremmel at the wall, and then on the drill, at speed 5. Slowly increase the speed to ~15
5. Position the oral dosing needle at the blade, approx 5cm from the tip of the needle. Hold the end furthest from the blade with your fingers, and the end closest to the blade with some pliers, making sure the pliers don't touch the moving drill bit
6. Cut the needle using the blade, keeping the needle as horizontal as possible. When you cut through half the needle, you can break it off with your hands

# Filing 
1. Once you've cut your 5cm lick spout, you'll need to file the edges until their smooth.
2. Position the lick spout at an angle, so its edges rests on the flat surface of the blade.
3. Rotate the lick spout slowly with your hands, until you get rid of the jagged ridges on the spout
4. Position the lick spout perpendicular against the flat surface of the blade, and file the opening of the spout. **You don't want to do this too much, as you want to void losing length on the spout**
5. Repeat step 2 until the edges of the spout are smooth
